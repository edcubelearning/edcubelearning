- 👋 Hi, I’m @edcubelearning
- 💻 I’m interested in web development with typescript and Node.js.
- 📖 I’m currently learning Java and SQL.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on my flagship project, EdCube.
- 📫 Contact me at edcubestudios@yahoo.com for business inquiries.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: The whole EdCube project was once scrapped due to a lack of personnel but our junior developer urged us to give us the project one more chance. We did, and now EdCube has more than 1,500 visitors daily.
